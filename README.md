## Plan on improving the project

It did not say to do in the brief but i thought that there should be a link to the about page as well. So I made it so that when you click on the logo in the header it takes you to the about page. Just didnt make sense that you could get to any page with a click of a button except the about page. Another improvement that could be made is to add a image of some of the menu items to the menu page.
